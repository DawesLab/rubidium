A suite of python code that is useful for calculating absorption spectra for the Rubidium D2-line.

Based on the paper by Paul Siddons:

Siddons et al. J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 41, 155004 (2008).

Also, heavily inspired by Mathematica code by the same author:

*********************************
Requirements (version guidelines)
*********************************

python (2.7)
Scipy (0.9.0)
matplotlib 
numpy

I recommend using the Enthought Python Distribution (either free or academic version). This provides the above requirements in one easy-to-install package.

********************
Installation & Usage
********************

The single-script python code RubidiumD2.py will generate absorption data for a vapor cell at a given temperature (in Kelvin) with length Lc (in meters). The detuning range generated can be set and defaults to -4 GHz through +6 GHz. The script generates a plot using pylab (matplotlib) and saves raw data to an ascii file.

*******************
Extending the code
*******************

Functions from this script can be imported and used in other python code. My intention is to continue to build on these features and maintain a useful python repository for numerical modeling in rubidium vapor systems.

Please contribute if you have more ideas and time. If this is useful, leave a comment and let me know what more you'd like it to do.
